## Description
Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS).

This application is to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

This project uses the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), [MySQL2 package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2), and [console.table package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table).
